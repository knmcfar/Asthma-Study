# 540 Midterm: Effects of Pollution on Lung Function of Children

A short individual report was created for the BIOST 540: Longitudinal and Multilevel Data Analysis midterm. This report aims to examine the relationship between lung function of asthmatic children (captured using FEV1 level) and pollution level over time using a generalized estimating equation model.

The report, R code, and csv file containing the dataset are uploaded to this repository. If the dataset is saved to the same directory that the working directory is set to, the dataset can be imported to R directly using the code.

# Lessons Learned

This project was a great chance to utilize and gain experience with a well-known longitudinal model, as well as think about best ways to display my findings in comprehensible tables and graphs. While the descriptive statistics do not capture the time-dependent relationship in this dataset well, the analysis using GEE allowed me to directly answer the scientific question of interest.
